wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - At the beginning of Wiimms-SZS-Tools I extraced the universal usable source
   code from Wiimms-ISO-Tools and created an independent C source code library
   called »dcLib«. I use this dcLib also for some other projects like mkw-ana,
   Wiimmfi, XDump and some more private projects. Now I inserted the expanded
   and more functional dcLib back into Wiimms-ISO-Tools and removed old WIT
   specific functions and members with same name or functionality. The great
   advantage is the easier management of the shared sources. The adapted code
   works fine with at least one issue: The error codes (numbers, not names)
   changed. If you used »wit error« to translate numbers to messages, you'll
   not have any problems.
 - New options: --color[=mode], --256-colors, --no-colors: Define the color
   mode of the tools. If a command is prefixed by 'C-', then --color=ON is
   used implicitly as default. By default, the color support is only enabled
   for terminals. However, commands have to be recoded to support colors.
 - List of commands with color support:
    - HELP (complete help system)
    - wit ID6 + ID8 (highlight unusal IDs)
    - wwt SPACE
 - Bug fix: When extracting GameCube images, »fst.bin« was 4 times too large.
 - Some minor fixes.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v2.8.1, 2017-07-03.
 - Apple Mac is no longer supported because I no longer have access to a Mac.
