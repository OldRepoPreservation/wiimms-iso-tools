 - New docu file: INSTALL.txt
 - Mac+Linux+Unix: Script 'install.sh' will call itself with 'sudo' if not
   started by user 'root'.
 - Windows: Cygwin updated.
 - Bug fix: If writing an image failed ('disc full' for example), the tools
   didn't aborted and, if option --remove was set, deleted the source image.
   This bug arrived with the implementation of preallocation, because of a
   lost error status.
