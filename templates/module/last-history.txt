wit v@@VERSION@@ r@@REV-NEXT@@ - @@@@-@@-@@

 - Write privileges are not longer needed, if a WBFS file or partiton is only
   read.
 - New command: wit ANAID (ANAlyze ID): Analyze the entered IDs and print one
   line for each ID with 3 columns: HEX_ID, ASCII_ID, Game title.
 - Little (compatible) changes for WDF v1.
 - New command: wit FRAGMENTS: Print the image fragments and, if possible,
   their filesystem mapping. Add option --brief (-b) to print only a summary
   with the fragment counts. Add option --long (-l) to print additonally
   alignment infos.
   *NOTE: Filesystem mapping is only supported on real linux systems (yet),
          but neither for Mac nor for Cygwin.
 - The image builder search now the file 'exclude.fst' to exclude files from
   the composing. See http://wit.wiimm.de/info/composing.html#part for details.
