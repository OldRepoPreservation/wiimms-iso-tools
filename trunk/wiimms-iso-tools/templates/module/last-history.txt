 - Command "wit DOLPATCH" accepts now more commands and is able to create new
   TEXT and DATA sections.
   -> Read http://wit.wiimm.de/cmd/wit/dolpatch for details.
 - New option: --tt-id=ID: This is a short cut for `--ticket=ID --tmd=ID´.
   If TICKET and TMD differ, the game will freeze after loading. So it make
   sense to change only TICKET and TMD IDs together.
 - Bug fix, if using "wit COPY --name discname" and the destination is %X or
   similar: The new discname is now used to create the filename.
