 - Option --scan-progress prints more info and flush every log output.
 - Bug fix: "wit MOVE a.wbfs ..." will work now.
 - New escapes for output files: The old '%f' is the source filename without
   path (like 'name.ext'). Now we have also '%g' and '%h' as split of '%f':
   '%g' is file name without extension ('name') and '%h' is the extension
   ('.ext').
 - Bug fix: "wit COPY --recurse a --dest b" threw an error, because the tool
   thought, that no source was defined (same as with --source before).
